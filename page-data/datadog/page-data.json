Re-designed and developed the Archdiocese's web page."],"datel":["A software house specialising in the creation of accounting software, specifically for Sage related products","Working in the full software lifecycle from raising quotes for work through to determining customers' requirements, developing these into technical documents and developing the systems required. Developed a good understanding of financials and three ledger bookkeeping."],"em":["Web design startup based in Manchester. I worked to turn web page designs into slick and professional marketing sites. A large project I worked on was to develop a social media platform for a series of nightclubs in Ibiza. The idea was to be a mini Facebook for the people attending the clubs in Ibiza. Designs and colour schemes were developed but much of the user interaction I designed and implemented myself with feedback from the client, etc."],"header":"I am an engineer who enjoys architectural challenges. I am comfortable writing software in multiple languages. I have designed, built and implemented high availability, high throughput SaaS systems from scratch using microservice, event-driven technologies utilising services in several cloud-based providers. I am a team leader with a strong background in improving teams and mentoring engineers. I have good organisational skills and have been utilised to coordinate multiple important cross-team projects. I have experience in the taking of scrums, sprint planning and undertaking retrospectives to ensure the continual development of team members and processes. I believe in data-driven, iterative, continuous-release software development where the customer is at the centre of all decisions and SOLID is the foundation of our software decisions. I think Test Driven Development is a great way to build software that doesn't break. I also believe \"premature optimisation being [sic] the root of all evil\" and, \"Good programmers write code that humans can understand\".","ivanti":["I am currently working within the main cloud framework team. We have ownership of multiple core areas of the main Neurons cloud product. Some of the areas I've worked on here include the login application, multiple UI components and our automation product, Assistants. We mainly use Javascript/Typescript for frontend and backend processes. Utilising frameworks such as Node.js, Webpack, Nx, Angular, Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.","I am currently leading a cross-team collaboration project of leading UI specialist engineers in the company. Ivanti has acquired multiple companies over the past 12 months. The goal of this project is to make these disparate products have a common look and feel. We are achieving this through regular meetings and shared problem-solving sessions. My role is to coordinate these actions, provide reviews and offer practical help where needed.","I am also working on a crucial integration project, vital to Ivanti's future direction. This involves forming a \"virtual team\" from engineers to V-level executives. Our goals are to integrate the Mobile Iron Cloud and Ivanti Neurons products. I'm playing a key role in this, coordinating with teams in India, the US and Australia as well as performing engineering tasks myself.","When I first joined Ivanti I worked on Ivanti's 'Edge Intelligence' product. It is predominantly a Node.js/TypeScript framework, Angular front-end with a C# endpoint engine. I improved the performance and processes of the team and decreased software turn-around time by 75%.","After this period the team moved further towards developing its software. We worked on an idea that I had developed, 'Snapshot'. This system provides solutions to endpoint issues. It does this by comparing machine states to discover changes made between a working and non-working state. I worked with product management and legal colleagues to develop this idea to produce a patent application (pending). We performed user research interviews and customer surveys to validate the idea and developed a plan to create software to address the problems. I then started work on a proof of concept and gradually moved the whole team to work on this product. The product is a series of Azure serverless 'Functions', a data lake to collect large amounts of data (terabytes), a Mongo Atlas 'index' as well as the related VSTS Pipelines and Terraform provisioning, etc."],"ljmu":["Designed and developed a web page to advertise student work placements. Website included a back-end admin panel and a front-end internet facing web page. Written in JavaScript, CSS and Classic ASP. This was the era of the 'browser wars' and IE and Netscape Navigator, web pages were difficult to develop."],"nicepak":["I was the Lead Developer in a small development team. I designed and implemented multiple software processes professionalising the team's work. Designing and implementing CI/CD process and technologies utilising Jenkins and Octopus deploy.","I took control of a failing manufacturing monitoring project (MES) and made it a success. This was a critical task and the failure of this project may have resulted in the closure of the whole engineering team. It was behind schedule, buggy and practically unusable when I first took control. I turned the project around completely rewriting the back-end system. We delivered the working system on time.","Other projects included a system to manage the signing-off of new products through the QA department and a system to store information on the constituent parts of each product. All software was written with a C#/SQL back-end and an Ember.js front-end.","I mentored and developed all members of this young and inexperienced team. Guiding and helping them professionalise and mature their work and processes. This included, among other things, introducing Test-Driven Development, microservice architecture and software monitoring processes as well as general guidance in producing robust software architectures and designs."],"redrow":["I was a Senior Developer working with two junior members. I was tasked with re-writing the London section of the company's main web page working in C# and using CMS Sitecore with a jQuery based UI.","I worked closely with the Marketing department to develop the look of the company's main web page. Working on designs developed by the marketeers, my job was to turn their ideas into slick and professional web pages. Redrow's web page is their store front-end Redrow prided itself on producing a quality product."],"sts":["I was Promoted to Senior Developer. Implemented rewrites of multiple frontend components as well as designing new functional UIs. This involved moving a legacy Webforms ASP.Net application into a Knockout.js based frontend. Interfacing with many complex third-party systems for flights and hotel rooms used by companies such as SkyScanner and Trip Advisor. Instigator and main driver of new technologies and methodologies in the company.","I was the main user interface developer and designer for the Stella B2C systems. Working without a design team I was often required to build our interfaces from scratch using my own design ideas. Our systems were used by Travel Agents looking for flights, hotels, packages, car hire, etc. We had to integrate with sophisticated complex systems providing real-time flight and hotel information. A particular challenge was every new year we would receive large loads on our systems as people looked for their post Christmas summer holidays. This required load testing of systems and interfaces to ensure that we could cope with demand."],"information":{"address":{"link":"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/53%C2%B011'12.1%22N+3%C2%B007'59.3%22W/@53.1866949,-3.135133,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0xcc22b5158e533ad2!7e2!8m2!3d53.1866921!4d-3.1331262","text":"12 Pen-Y-Bryn, Sychdyn, Flintshire, CH7 6EE"},"email":{"link":"mailto:sonic1981@gmail.com","text":"sonic1981@gmail.com"},"phone":{"link":"tel:07834174595","text":"07834174595"}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"0c0c7108-fec7-5415-91ac-21be5cb67041"}},
