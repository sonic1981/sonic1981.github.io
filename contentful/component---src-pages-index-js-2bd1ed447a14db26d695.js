Ivanti has acquired multiple companies over the past 12 months. The goal of this project is to make these disparate products have a common look and feel. We are achieving this through regular meetings and shared problem-solving sessions. My role is to coordinate these actions, provide reviews and offer practical help where needed.","I am also working on a crucial integration project, vital to Ivanti's future direction. This involves forming a \"virtual team\" from engineers to V-level executives. Our goals are to integrate the Mobile Iron Cloud and Ivanti Neurons products. I'm playing a key role in this, coordinating with teams in India, the US and Australia as well as performing engineering tasks myself.","When I first joined Ivanti I worked on Ivanti's 'Edge Intelligence' product. It is a mixture of Node.js/TypeScript middleware, Angular front-end and a C# endpoint engine. I improved the performance and processes of the team and decreased software turn-around time by 75%.","After this period the team moved further towards developing its software. We worked on an idea that I had developed, 'Snapshot'. This is a system to provide solutions to endpoint issues. It does this by comparing machine states to discover changes made between a working and non-working state. I worked with product management and legal colleagues to develop this idea to produce a patent application (pending). We performed user research interviews and customer surveys to validate the idea and developed a plan to create software to address the problems. I then started work on a proof of concept and gradually moved the whole team to work on this product. The product is a series of Azure serverless 'Functions' written in C#, a data lake to collect large amounts of data (terabytes), a Mongo Atlas 'index' as well as the related VSTS Pipelines and Terraform provisioning, etc.","I am currently working within the main cloud framework team. We have ownership of multiple core areas of the main Neurons cloud product. Some of the areas I've worked on here include the login application, multiple UI components and our automation product, Assistants.

This was a critical task and the failure of this project may have resulted in the closure of the whole engineering team. It was behind schedule, buggy and practically unusable when I first took control. I turned the project around completely rewriting the back-end system.
